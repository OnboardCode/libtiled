# libtiled-net - .NET library to work with Tiled maps

This is a small library meant to make it easy to use Tiled maps in your .net
project. It is based on the Java project version included in Tiled repo, and the sources are generated by a [tool](https://github.com/paulirwin/JavaToCSharp).
I had to make some adjustments because the files generated have some issues, but its nothing hard.
In future i consider generate classes from schemas, but for now the java2c# tool make it work.
